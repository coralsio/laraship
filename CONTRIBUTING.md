## How to Contribute

### Finding Issues

- Look through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/coralsio/laraship/issues) for open issues that need attention.
- Filter by labels such as "good first issue" or "help wanted" if you're looking for beginner-friendly tasks.
- If you don't see an issue that matches your skills or interests, feel free to open a new one to suggest a feature, report a bug, or propose an improvement.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
- Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`, depending on the project's package manager.
- Follow the project-specific instructions for setting up any additional tools or configurations.

### Making Changes

- Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`.
